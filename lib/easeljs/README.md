# lib directory
This directory contains compressed versions of the EaselJS library, including the most recent tagged release and the 
in-progress NEXT release.

Both combined and minified versions of the library are included. The former being useful for debugging, and the latter 
for deployment.

You can also link to the libraries on the [CreateJS CDN](http://code.createjs.com/), to benefit from faster load times 
and shared caching across sites.


# libraries
* **easeljs.js** the most recent _tagged_ version of all the EaselJS classes.
* **easeljs.min.js** the most recent tagged version, minified and stripped of comments and whitespace.
* **easeljs-NEXT.js** contains the _latest_ EaselJS classes.
* **easeljs-NEXT.min.js** is a minified version of the _latest updates_ to the library.

Note that previous versions also had a webgl library, but it has been replaced by `StageGL`, which is included in the
minified source.
